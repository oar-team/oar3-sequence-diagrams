# Sequence diagrams code and generation for oar3 documentation

This repository contains the source code to generate the sequence diagrams presented in [oar3 documentation](https://oar-3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/internal.html).
The diagrams are written in [plantuml's DSL](https://plantuml.com/sequence-diagram), and generated by it.

## Build the diagrams

The easiest way to build the diagrams is by using nix:

- Either build directly the diagrams with `nix build`
- Or, enter into a `nix shell` containing plantuml to build the diagrams manually (`plantuml diag.pu`)
